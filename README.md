# TablistResizer
An extremely simple bukkit plugin for minecraft to enforce a tablist size of 80 players, to get 1.7 clients to see 4 columns.

_Note_: This plugin has a dependency on ProtocolLib, you'll need it on your server too.

To compile, run `mvn clean install` and you can find your final jar in the `target` output folder
